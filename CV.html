                        My name is Alessia, and I am 25 years old. <br>
                        I am writing this brief cover letter because <br>
                        I am interested in applying for a specific position in this sector: <br>
                        the role of a manual weed trimmer. <br>
                        I have two years of experience in this job <br>
                        that I praticed in a precise, diligent, and efficient way. <br><br>
                        Allow me to introduce myself briefly: <br>
                        I consider myself a multipotentialite, <br>
                        someone who is passionate about various interests. <br>
                        In addition to graduating from an art high school, <br>
                        I hold a degree in social services. <br>
                        During my studies, I achieved a B1 English level. <br>
                        Maybe my English's level isn't high enough, but <br>
                        I want to improve it <br>
                        especially given my upcoming move to the Netherlands, <br>
                        a plan I set in motion five years ago with Haarlem as my destination.<br>
                        I also have a basic knowledge of the Dutch language, <br>
                        which I acquired independently using the Duolingo app<br><br>
                        I believe that my skills and determination would be valuable assets to your team. <br>
                        I sincerely hope you will consider my application<br>
                        for the manual weed trimmer position. <br><br>
                        Thank you for your attention, <br>
                        I remain available for any additional information you may require.</div>
